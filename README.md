Nowcasting and Dynamic Factor Models

In economics, numerous indicators are used to understand the state of a country and its evolution (GDP, Consumption, Happiness, etc.). The creation of these variables is complex, often requiring several months of surveys, calculations and modeling. For example, France's GDP is only published 4 times a year by INSEE, with a two-month delay. 
In recent years, however, a growing number of data sets have become available at high frequencies (daily, weekly or monthly). These can provide us with information on the evolution of the economy and enable us to predict economic indicators within a shorter period of time.
 
The aim of this project is to use mixed-frequency models to evaluate and predict economic indicators more frequently (this field is called “Nowcasting”). In addition, we 

will be looking at MIDAS and Dynamic Factor Models. The latter class of models enables us to use a large number of time series and identify trends.
Finally, we'll take a closer look at the predictive power of these models, as well as their assumptions and limitations.
